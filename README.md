# BrandImageGenerator
Superimpose the profile picture of a twitter handle onto a branding image.


To use this app, you **need** Twitter API Keys. Get them at [https://apps.twitter.com](apps.twitter.com/). Visit the Keys and Access Tokens tab to plug in the four keys you need into the app.config file.

To customize the brand image, *without modifying code*, you need a brand image 600x300. There should be a blank square 210x210 20px from the left edge, centered vertically.

 - You can swap your image out from brand.jpg
 - Or, place the path to the file in the app.config.
 
You can also change the branding color and name of the app via the app.config as well.
